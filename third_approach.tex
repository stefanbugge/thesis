The third approach to creating AHIs that we presented in chapter~\ref{ch:adhoc} was to construct the interface on the spot.
Of the three approaches this is the one that we have explored the least.

This approach originated from the idea of interfaces that was ``fashioned from whatever is immediately available''.
While this may not be quite possible, the idea, or vision, is engaging and intriguing, because how do you go about making such a system?

We have done a few experiments to explore the concept, though a bit cursory.
The main challenge is to find materials, or a generic enough platform, that allows you to create objects or environments with interactive capabilities from \emph{whatever is immediately available}
