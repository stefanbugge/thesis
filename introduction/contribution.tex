We see the primary contribution of our thesis as twofold.
(1) We introduce the notion of ad hoc interfaces, a notion that we ground in both existing literature and in design practice. 
This involves a definition of what make up the core principles of an ad hoc interface as well as a positioning of IT within the field of ubiquitous computing. 
(2) An exploration of concrete approaches to the construction of ad hoc interfaces through prototype and concept development.

We hope that this work can shed light on the potentials of ad hoc interfaces and maybe even inspire further research into this area.
