We see the primary contribution of our thesis as twofold.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{We introduce the notion of ad hoc interfaces as a novel human-computer interface approach and ground the notion in both existing literature and through design experiments. 
This involves a definition of what makes up the core principles of an ad hoc interface as well as a positioning within the field of ubiquitous computing.}

\item{We present an exploration of concrete approaches to the construction of ad hoc interfaces through prototype and concept development.}
\end{enumerate}
We hope that this work can shed light on the potentials of ad hoc interfaces and maybe even inspire further research into this area.
