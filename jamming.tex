\todo{ref til ad hoc construction principle} 
For our first \hl{prototype description} we will dig into the area of shape changing interfaces, SCIs.
We will do this to explore and illustrate the possibilities of creating AHIs based on shape-change.
More specifically we will touch upon a specific approach to constructing SCIs called jamming.
SCIs were introduced in the introduction of this thesis as interfaces that use physical change of shape as input or output.
Jamming is special kind of technique that can be used to control the stiffness of a material which makes it possible to construct objects that can change their surface structure.
What makes SCIs interesting to AHIs is it''s ability to dynamically change the physical properties of an interface element, be it shape, texture, stiffness, position ect.
This change in physicality can then be the offset for a new temporary interaction possibility that is created for the specific situation, where afterwards it can return to it''s initial natural state.
This aspect aligns well with the definition of AHIs that we presented earlier in section \todo{ref to AHI section}
