One of the research areas that have stemmed from ubiquitous computing is electronic textiles or `E-Textiles', which seeks to integrate electronic and computation into fabric.
\citet{park2002wearable} presents the E-Textile vision as a paradigme of the ``fabric is the computer'', taking Weiser's much quoted description of ubiquitous computing very litteral.
